Introduction

Welcome to the Puffed Rice Mixer project repository! This project aims to create a mechatronic system for mixing and blending puffed rice with flavorings or additives. The system combines mechanical, electrical, and software components to achieve precise and efficient mixing operations.

Project Components

1. Mechanical Design: This section includes the CAD files, schematics, and design documents for the mechanical aspects of the puffed rice mixer. It covers the structure, mixing blades, and assembly instructions.

2. Electrical Components: Here, you'll find the circuit diagrams, PCB designs, and Bill of Materials (BOM) for the electrical system of the mixer. This includes motors, sensors, controllers, and power supply units.

3. Software Implementation: This section focuses on the software side of the project. It includes code repositories, algorithms for mixing control, user interfaces, and communication protocols used in the mechatronic system.

4. Testing and Validation: Documentation and reports related to testing procedures, validation results, and performance analysis are included in this section. It provides insights into how well the system meets its design specifications.
